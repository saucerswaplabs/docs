For general partnership inquiries, you can contact us via email: [outreach@saucerswap.finance](mailto:outreach@saucerswap.finance), or by completing a [request form](https://z30ev00547x.typeform.com/to/YBGqwGup).

## Adding a Token

Anybody can 'list' a Hedera (HTS) token on SaucerSwap. You don't need to submit a request or ask permission; just create a liquidity pool, that's it. For V1 pool creation, see [Liquidity Pool Tutorials](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/get-started/saucerswap-tutorials/liquidity/saucerswap-v1).

Once there is at least 1 liquidity pool, users can then trade your token by entering the token ID (e.g. 0.0.12345)

## How to Add Token Icon/Logo

Token information displayed on [saucerswap.finance](https://saucerswap.finance) is referenced from 2 sources:

- An IPFS or Arweave metadata link in the token's memo or metadata field, conforming to the [Hedera fungible token Metadata schema](https://hips.hedera.com/hip/hip-405#schema).
  - Note: updating metadata requires a token having an admin or metadata key
- Token icon and information added to [Davinci Pics](https://davincigraph.io/#pics_home)
  - Note: adding or updating Davinci Pics data requires connecting the token's treasury account ID (or the account ID which executed the token create transaction) to Davinci to authenticate.

## Yield Farm (V1)

Yield farming on SaucerSwap allows liquidity providers to stake their LP tokens in the Masterchef Farm contract to earn dual rewards in both HBAR and SAUCE. The Masterchef contract handles LP token staking and unstaking, as well as the automated minting and distribution of SAUCE rewards, according to a pre-set emission schedule.

Projects are eligible for a [yield farm](/o/BOkM6pAr15Wrz4Gy8QVh/s/5hXF6kx1TaOoCMAhLCv3/protocol/saucerswap-v1#yield-farm) once their token has been added to either the default or extended list on the SaucerSwap interface.

Proposals for creating or amending yield farm campaigns are under the scope of SaucerSwap Governance, and must follow the [governance process](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance/overview#governance-process). Each proposals must specify which[ farm weights](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1/farm-weights) would be adjusted to create the new farm.

All approved yield farms will feature dual token emissions in the form of SAUCE and HBAR.

## LARI (V2)

The [Liquidity-Aligned Reward Initiative](/o/BOkM6pAr15Wrz4Gy8QVh/s/5hXF6kx1TaOoCMAhLCv3/protocol/saucerswap-v2#liquidity-aligned-reward-initiative-lari) (LARI) is integrated into SaucerSwap V2, offering liquidity providers a way to earn additional incentives without staking. Activated upon creation of a V2 position, LARI allocates rewards in accordance with the size and efficacy of the liquidity contributed.

LARI supports the distribution of multiple HTS tokens across various liquidity pools, thereby allowing projects to tailor campaigns specific to their token. These rewards are automatically distributed via airdrop at the end of two-week epochs.

Proposals for creating or amending LARI campaigns are under the scope of SaucerSwap Governance, and must follow the [governance process](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance/overview#governance-process). Each proposal must specify the duration of the campaign and the allocation of token(s) per epoch.

For initiating a LARI campaign, inquiries can be directed to [outreach@saucerswap.finance](mailto:outreach@saucerswap.finance).
