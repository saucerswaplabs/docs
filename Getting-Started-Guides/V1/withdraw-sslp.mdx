To convert your liquidity back into the two original tokens:

1. Visit the Liquidity page.
2. Find the pool where your ssLP tokens belong.
3. Navigate to the Unstake & Withdraw tab.
4. Click **Withdraw Liquidity**, enter the amount, and confirm.

You’ll receive both tokens in your wallet based on your share of the pool — including fees earned during the time your liquidity was active.
