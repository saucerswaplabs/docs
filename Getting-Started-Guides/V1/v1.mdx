SaucerSwap V1 is the first version of the DEX (decentralized exchange) that uses a **simple liquidity model** called the _constant product formula_ (`x * y = k`).

\
You deposit **equal value of two tokens** (like HBAR and USDC) into a pool, and traders swap between them.

\
Liquidity Providers (LPs) earn trading fees automatically based on how much of the pool they own.
