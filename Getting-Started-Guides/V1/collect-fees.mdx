In V1, fees are automatically added back into the liquidity pool.\
To collect your share:

- You’ll need to **unstake** from the farm (if staked) and then **remove your liquidity** from the pool.\
  When you do, you’ll receive your original tokens plus any fees earned, proportional to your share of the pool.
