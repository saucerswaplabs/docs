To provide liquidity:

1. Go to the **Pools** section on SaucerSwap.
2. Select a token pair with an active pool.
3. Enter how much of a token you'd like to deposit — the platform will auto-set the ratio. 
4. Click **Approve and Supply** and approve the transaction in your wallet.

In return, you’ll receive **ssLP tokens** (SaucerSwap Liquidity Provider tokens), which represent your share in the pool.
