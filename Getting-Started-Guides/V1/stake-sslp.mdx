To earn **extra rewards**, you can stake your ssLP tokens in a yield farm:

1. Navigate to the **Liquidity** tab.
2. Find the corresponding farm for the pair you just provided liquidity to.
3. Click on **Manage Position**.
4. Click **Stake and Farm**, enter the number of ssLP tokens you want to stake, and confirm the transaction.

Youâ€™ll now earn additional rewards (like SAUCE) on top of your portion of swap fees.
