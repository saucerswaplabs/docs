An **RFC (Request for Comment)** is an early, informal post used to gather community feedback before making an official proposal.

Steps to submit an RFC:

1. Go to the SaucerSwap Governance Forum. https://gov.saucerswap.finance/
2. Create a new post under the **"RFC" category**.
3. Ask for community feedback.
4. Revise based on comments if necessary.

**Tip:** RFCs are not final. Theyâ€™re meant for brainstorming and improving ideas before formal proposals.
