When a proposal passes the first round of voting (reaching quorum with a majority "Yes" vote), it automatically moves into the **Election Phase**.

During the Election, at least **15 million votes** must be cast with a majority "Yes" for the election to pass.

Once the Election is successfully passed, the proposal will be officially **implemented** on SaucerSwap.
