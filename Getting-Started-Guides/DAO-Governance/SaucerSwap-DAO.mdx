SaucerSwap’s DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) lets the community help guide the future of the platform. Anyone holding voting power (like SAUCE and xSAUCE holders) can propose ideas, discuss improvements, and vote on key decisions — everything from new features to treasury spending.

Getting involved usually follows a three-step flow:

1. **Discuss ideas** on the governance forum.
2. **Submit formal proposals** after gathering feedback.

**Vote on-chain** to make final decisions binding.

SaucerSwap DAO works by empowering SAUCE and xSAUCE holders (and future governance participants) to:

- Discuss and refine ideas publicly on a forum.
- Create formal proposals for big changes.
- Vote using their token-based voting power on important matters.

The DAO manages platform-level decisions like:

- Protocol upgrades
- Fee changes
- Treasury usage
- Staking or liquidity incentives

Here’s the governance flow at a glance:

1. **RFC (Request for Comment)**: Early discussion of ideas happens on the governance forum.
2. **Formal Proposal Submission**: After feedback, an RFC is turned into a full proposal on the governance forum.
3. **Proposal On-Chain Voting**: Some proposals go to an on-chain vote (5M votes, majority Yes), where SAUCE and xSAUCE holders vote using their tokens.
4. **Election On-Chain Voting**: Proposals that passed quorum (15M votes, majority Yes) automatically go to Election on-chain voting, where SAUCE and xSAUCE holders vote using their tokens.
5. **Execution**: If the Election passes with enough support, it’s implemented.

Votes are weighted based on the amount of voting power (tokens) each participant has.
