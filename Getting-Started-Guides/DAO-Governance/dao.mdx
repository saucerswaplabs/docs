A DAO is a community-led organization where decisions are made collectively through votes, without relying on a central authority.

Instead of executives making decisions behind closed doors, the DAO’s rules and proposals are voted on transparently by the token-holding community.

In SaucerSwap’s case, the DAO allows users and contributors to help shape upgrades, policies, and key initiatives.
