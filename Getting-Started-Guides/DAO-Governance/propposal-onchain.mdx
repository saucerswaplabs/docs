If a forum proposal gains enough support (usually based on community signaling or minimum forum activity), it can move **on-chain**.

Steps:

1. Go to SaucerSwap’s governance portal (linked from the DAO page).
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Select **Submit Proposal**.
4. Fill out the on-chain proposal details — typically a shorter, formal version summarizing what was posted on the forum.
5. Pay the small network fee (requires HBAR).
6. The proposal enters a **voting period** where SAUCE/xSAUCE holders can vote "Yes" or "Against".

If enough tokens vote **Yes** and minimum quorum requirements are met, the proposal passes and moves to Elections.
