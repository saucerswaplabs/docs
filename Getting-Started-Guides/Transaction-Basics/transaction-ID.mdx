A transaction hash (also called a transaction ID) is a unique identifier assigned to a specific transaction on the blockchain, or distributed ledger for Hedera. It’s like a digital receipt that proves your transaction happened. You can use the transaction hash to look up all the details of the transaction — like when it was sent, how much was sent, and which wallets were involved — on a blockchain explorer.
