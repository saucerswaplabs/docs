When you make a transaction on Hedera (like sending tokens or swapping on SaucerSwap), it gets recorded on the network and can be viewed publicly using an explorer, such as[ ](https://hashscan.io/)[<u>HashScan.io</u>](http://HashScan.io).

Here’s how to read the main parts of a transaction:

[take a snapshot of a transaction ID]

- **Transaction Hash/ID:**\
   A unique code that identifies the transaction. You can use this to look it up anytime.
- **Timestamp:**\
   The exact date and time the transaction was confirmed on the network.
- **Transaction Type:**\
   What kind of action was performed — like a crypto transfer, token swap, smart contract call, etc.
- **Sender and Receiver:**\
   The wallet addresses involved. The sender is who initiated the transaction, and the receiver is who got the funds or tokens.
- **Amount:**\
   How much was sent or transferred, including the type of token (HBAR, USDC, SAUCE, etc.).
- **Transaction Fee:**\
   The small network fee that was paid to process the transaction.
- **Status:**\

Sometimes, a short note or tag is attached to a transaction for additional information.
