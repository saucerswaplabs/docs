A network cost is the small fee you pay to use a blockchain. Every time you make a transaction — like sending tokens, swapping tokens, or interacting with a smart contract — you pay this fee to cover the resources needed to process and secure the transaction. On Hedera (the network SaucerSwap uses), network costs are very low compared to other blockchains like Ethereum, often costing just a fraction of a cent, charged in HBAR.
