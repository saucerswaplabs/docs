A network cost is the small fee you pay to use a blockchain or network. Every time you make a transaction — like sending tokens, swapping tokens, or interacting with a smart contract — you pay this fee to cover the resources needed to process and secure the transaction. On Hedera (the network SaucerSwap uses), network costs are very low compared to other blockchains like Ethereum, often costing just a fraction of a cent, charged in HBAR.

Hedera network costs are set by the Hedera Governing Council and are based on the actual resources a transaction uses, like computing power, storage, and bandwidth. Each type of transaction — such as transferring tokens, swapping tokens, or interacting with a smart contract — has a standard fee. Unlike many blockchains where fees can spike with congestion, Hedera's fees are stable, predictable, and usually just a few cents or less.
