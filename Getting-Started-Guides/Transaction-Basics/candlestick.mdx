A candlestick chart shows the price movement of a token (or any asset) over time. Each "candlestick" represents what happened to the price during a specific time period — like 1 minute, 1 hour, or 1 day.

Each candlestick has four key parts:

- **Open:** The price when the period started.
- **Close:** The price when the period ended.
- **High:** The highest price reached during the period.
- **Low:** The lowest price reached during the period.

**The candlestick body and color tell you the trend:**

- If the candle is **green** (or sometimes white), it means the price went _up_ — the close price is higher than the open price.
- If the candle is **red** (or sometimes black), it means the price went _down_ — the close price is lower than the open price.

**The lines above and below the body (called "wicks" or "shadows")** show the highest and lowest prices traded during that time, even if the price didn’t stay there.

**Quick Example:** 

Imagine you’re looking at a 1-hour candlestick:

- It opened at \$1.00 (Open)
- Reached \$1.10 (High)
- Dropped to \$0.95 (Low)
- Closed at \$1.05 (Close)\
  Since it closed higher than it opened, the candlestick would be green.
