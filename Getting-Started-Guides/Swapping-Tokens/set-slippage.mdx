On SaucerSwap:

1. Click the **Settings** button (gear icon) inside the swap window.
2. Set your **slippage tolerance** â€” common options are 0.1%, 0.5%, or 1%.
3. You can also manually type a custom slippage amount.

Choosing higher slippage can help large trades succeed but may result in worse prices. Choosing lower slippage protects you from big price swings but may cause your trade to fail if the market moves too fast.
