HBAR is the native cryptocurrency of the Hedera network. It's used to pay for network fees (like transaction costs), power smart contracts, and secure the network through staking and governance. On SaucerSwap, you'll often need a small amount of HBAR in your wallet to complete swaps or other actions.
