Swap fees are small fees charged whenever you swap tokens on SaucerSwap.\
These fees are split between:

- Liquidity providers (people who supply tokens to pools)
- The protocol (for buybacks and other platform operations)

The fee amount depends on the pool, but it usually ranges from **0.05% to 1%** per swap.

For V1, it is a fixed 0.30%, while V2 offers variable rates of 0.05%, 0.15%, 0.30%, or 1.00%. Out of the collected fee, 5/6 goes to liquidity providers, and the remaining 1/6 is allocated to the protocol.
