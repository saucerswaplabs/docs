On SaucerSwap, you swap one cryptocurrency for another. To buy a token:

1. Connect your crypto wallet to SaucerSwap.
2. Choose the token you want to swap **from** (like HBAR) and the token you want to swap **to**.

   [PG-007]
3. Enter the amount and confirm the swap.
4. Pay a small network fee, and the new tokens will appear in your wallet.

   [PG-008]

You must already have crypto (like HBAR) in your wallet to swap.
