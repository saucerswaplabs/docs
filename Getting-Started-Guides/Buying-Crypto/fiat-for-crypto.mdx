Selling fiat for crypto just means **using your regular money (like USD, EUR, etc.) to buy cryptocurrency**.\
 Here’s how to do it:

1. **Sign up on a crypto exchange** that supports fiat payments (like Coinbase, Binance, [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com), or even directly through SaucerSwap’s Coinbase Pay feature).
2. **Complete KYC verification** (upload an ID and sometimes proof of address) — this is usually required before you can buy.
3. **Choose a payment method**, such as:
   - Debit card
   - Bank transfer (ACH or wire transfer)
   - Sometimes Apple Pay or Google Pay
4. **Select the cryptocurrency** you want to buy (like HBAR, USDC, BTC, etc.).
5. **Enter the amount of fiat** you want to spend and review the fees.
6. **Confirm the purchase**, and your crypto will be deposited into your wallet or account.

**Example:**\
If you use a debit card to buy \$100 worth of HBAR, after confirming the transaction, you will see HBAR appear in your account or connected wallet, minus any fees.
