**KYC (Know Your Customer)** is a verification process where you provide personal information to prove your identity.\
This often includes:

- A government-issued ID (passport, driverâ€™s license)
- A selfie photo
- Sometimes proof of address (like a utility bill)

KYC is required by law for most platforms when buying crypto with fiat to prevent fraud and money laundering.
