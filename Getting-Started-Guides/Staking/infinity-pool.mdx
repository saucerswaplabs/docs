The **Infinity Pool** is a special staking pool for SAUCE holders. Users stake SAUCE and receive xSAUCE. The Infinity Pool automatically compounds via SAUCE buybacks from three sources: HBAR native staking, farm emissions, and a portion of swap fees from all liquidity pools.

The Infinity Pool has no fixed staking period â€” you can stake and unstake anytime.
