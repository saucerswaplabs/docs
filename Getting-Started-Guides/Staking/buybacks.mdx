SAUCE Buybacks are when SaucerSwap uses a portion of platform revenue (like swap interface fees) to **buy SAUCE tokens** from the market.\
 The bought SAUCE is sent to the Infinity Pool, boosting the value of everyoneâ€™s xSAUCE holdings.\
 Buybacks help support the price of SAUCE and reward long-term stakers.

In short: **More revenue = more buybacks = more rewards for stakers.**
