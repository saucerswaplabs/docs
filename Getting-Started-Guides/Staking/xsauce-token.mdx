xSAUCE (0.0.1460200) is a token you receive when you stake SAUCE in the Infinity Pool.\
 It represents your share of the poolâ€™s total value, including:

- Your original staked SAUCE.
- Rewards from SAUCE buybacks and redistribution.

Over time, **each xSAUCE becomes worth more SAUCE**, meaning your position grows automatically the longer you stay staked.

You can redeem xSAUCE back for SAUCE whenever you want.
