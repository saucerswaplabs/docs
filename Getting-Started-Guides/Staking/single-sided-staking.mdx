Single Sided Staking lets you stake just **one token** (like SAUCE) without needing to pair it with another token. It’s easier and safer than providing liquidity because you're not exposed to **impermanent loss**. You simply deposit your tokens into a staking pool and earn rewards over time.

SaucerSwap has a single-sided staking mechanism called the “Infinity Pool” where users can Stake SAUCE and receive xSAUCE. The Infinity Pool automatically compounds via SAUCE buybacks from three sources: HBAR native staking, farm emissions, and a portion of swap fees from all liquidity pools.
