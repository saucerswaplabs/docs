If you're in the **Infinity Pool**, rewards are automatically built into the growing value of your xSAUCE — **no manual claiming needed**. Infinity Pool staking is designed to be fully **auto-compounding** — making it easy for users to just stake and chill\!

If you're in a **SaucerSwap V1 yield farm** that distributes rewards separately, you may have a **Claim** button available:

1. Go to the Liquidity page.
2. Find your V1 yield farm.
3. Click **Harvest Rewards** to transfer the rewards to your wallet.

4. Go to the Liquidity page.
5. Find your position.
6. Click **Claim Rewards** to transfer the rewards to your wallet.

If you're in a **SaucerSwap V2 pool that has LARI rewards,** the LARI rewards will be airdropped bi-weekly.
