Hedera Testnet is a testing version of the Hedera network where developers and users can experiment without using real money. It works just like the Mainnet, but transactions on the Testnet use test tokens with no real-world value. Testnet is used to safely try out apps, smart contracts, and features before they go live on the Mainnet.
