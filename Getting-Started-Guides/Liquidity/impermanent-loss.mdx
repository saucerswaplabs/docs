Impermanent loss happens when the prices of the tokens you provide to a pool change compared to when you deposited them. If you had simply held the tokens instead of providing liquidity, you might have had more value. The "loss" is called _impermanent_ because if prices return to where they started, the loss goes away â€” but if you withdraw at a different price, the loss becomes permanent.
