A **range order** is when you add liquidity only within a specific, narrow price range, almost like setting a "limit order" on a traditional exchange. SaucerSwap has three preset ranges, Focused, Balanced, and Relaxed.

If the token price enters your chosen range, your liquidity gets used heavily, maximizing fee earnings. If the price moves outside your range, your liquidity goes inactive until the price returns to your set range.
