Single-sided liquidity is when you provide **only one token** to a liquidity pool instead of both tokens. Some liquidity pools or protocols allow this to make it easier for users who donâ€™t want to split their funds between two assets.

(As of now, SaucerSwap offers Single-sided liquidity in SAUCE/HBAR V2 Autopool. SaucerSwap mainly focuses on two-token liquidity, but future updates or certain pools may explore single-sided options.)
