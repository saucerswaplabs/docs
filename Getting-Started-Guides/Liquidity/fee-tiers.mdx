title: "What are fee tiers?"
---

Fee tiers are different swap fee options for liquidity pools. When creating a pool or adding liquidity, you can choose a fee tier based on expected trading activity and risk:

- **Low fees (0.05%)** are best for stable or highly traded pairs (like USDC/HBAR).
- **Higher fees (1%)** are better for volatile or risky token pairs.

Choosing the right fee tier helps balance trader costs and liquidity provider rewards.Â 

In SaucerSwap, each swap charges a small fee:

- **V1 Pools:** Flat 0.30% swap fee.
- **V2 Pools:** Flexible swap fees between 0.05% and 1.00%, depending on the pool.
