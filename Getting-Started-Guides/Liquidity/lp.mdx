title: "What is a liquidity pool?"
---

A liquidity pool is a collection of tokens locked in a smart contract that traders can swap between. Instead of needing a buyer and seller to match directly, SaucerSwap uses liquidity pools so users can trade instantly at prices set by the poolâ€™s balance. Liquidity pools are created and maintained by users who deposit two tokens into the pool.
