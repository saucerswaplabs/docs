Bridging tokens means moving your tokens from one blockchain to another (e.g., from Ethereum to Hedera).\
 To bridge:

1. Use a trusted bridge (like Hashport for Hedera). https://www.hashport.network/
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Select the token and network you are sending **from** and the network you are sending **to**.
4. Approve the transaction and pay any fees.
5. Once completed, your tokens will appear as a "wrapped" version.

**Note:** Bridging can take a few minutes and often costs network and bridge fees.
