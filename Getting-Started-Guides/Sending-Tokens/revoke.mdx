To remove a token approval:

1. Use a **token manager** or **wallet app** that supports approvals.
2. Find the list of tokens you've given spending permissions for.
3. Select the token and click **Revoke**.
4. Confirm the revoke transaction (this costs a small network fee).

This increases wallet security by removing unused or unnecessary permissions.
