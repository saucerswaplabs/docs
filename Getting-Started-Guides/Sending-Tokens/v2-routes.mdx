1. When setting up a swap on SaucerSwap, look for the **Routing Options** button (or advanced settings).
2. Select **V2 Only** to force your swap to use V2 concentrated liquidity pools.
3. This ensures your swap happens only through the V2 model, which can offer tighter pricing if liquidity is available.
