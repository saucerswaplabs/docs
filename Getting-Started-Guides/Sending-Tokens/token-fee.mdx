Some tokens have built-in transfer fees (also called reflection or burn fees).\
Whenever you move or swap these tokens, a small percentage is automatically deducted. This happens at the smart contract level — it’s not a SaucerSwap fee or a network fee.

You’ll usually see a **token warning** if a token has fees.
