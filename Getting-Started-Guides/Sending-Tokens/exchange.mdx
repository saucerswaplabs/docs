To send tokens from your wallet to a centralized exchange (like Coinbase or Binance):

1. Go to your exchange and find the **Deposit** section.
2. Select the correct token you want to deposit (e.g., USDC, HBAR).
3. Copy the **deposit address and memo** provided by the exchange.
4. Open your wallet, select the token, input memo and **Send** it to the copied deposit address.
5. Confirm the network is correct (for example, Hedera network for HBAR/HTS tokens).
6. Approve and send the transaction.

**Always double-check** that the address and network match exactly to avoid losing your tokens.
