title: "Why is liquidity position ownership represented by tokens or NFTs?"

In V2, each liquidity position is **customized** (your chosen range, deposit size, timing, etc.).\
Because each one is unique, it's represented by an **NFT (non-fungible token)**.\
That NFT proves your ownership and allows you to:

- View your position
- Claim fees
- Transfer or even sell the position in the future

In contrast, V1 uses **ssLP tokens** because all liquidity is pooled evenly and not range-specific.
