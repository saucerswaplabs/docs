After creating a manual position:

1. Navigate to the **My Positions** tab.
2. Select the position you want to manage.\
   You can:

- **Add or remove liquidity**.
- **Collect earned fees** (when your position is in-range).
- **Close or rebalance** your position if the price has moved outside your selected range.

Manual positions require more attention but offer higher potential rewards.
