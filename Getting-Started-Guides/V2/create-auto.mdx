Auto positions are for users who want a simpler experience:

1. Go to the **Pools** tab and select a V2 pair.
2. Choose **New Position (Auto)**.

   [PG-046]
3. Select the token vault.
4. Deposit your tokens and confirm.

   [PG-047]

Your position is still represented by an ERC-20 tokens, but you don’t have to worry about price range selection or rebalancing. It’s more passive and beginner-friendly.
