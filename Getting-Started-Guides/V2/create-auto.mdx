Auto positions are for users who want a simpler experience:

1. Choose **Add Liquidity (Auto)**.
2. SaucerSwap automatically selects a **dynamic price range** and manages it over time.
3. Deposit your tokens and confirm.

Your position is still represented by an NFT, but you don’t have to worry about price range selection or rebalancing. It’s more passive and beginner-friendly.
