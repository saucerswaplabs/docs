To create a manual liquidity position:

1. Go to the **Pools** tab and select a V2 pair.
2. Click **New Position (Manual)**.

   [PG-048]
3. Set a custom **price range** where you want your tokens to be active.
4. Enter the token amounts and confirm the transaction.

   [PG-049]

You’ll receive an **NFT** that represents this specific liquidity position — including its price range and amount.
