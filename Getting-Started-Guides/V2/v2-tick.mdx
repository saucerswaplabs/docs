In V2, the price range is broken into small units called **ticks**.\
Ticks define the upper and lower bounds where your liquidity is active.\
When you choose a range (like \$0.05–\$0.07), you’re actually choosing **tick boundaries** behind the scenes.\
This allows fine-tuned control and efficiency.
