Yes, you can. When adding liquidity, you can choose a **"full range"** option.\
This ensures your liquidity is always active, no matter the price.\
However, it’s **less capital-efficient** because your tokens are spread too thin, which can reduce your fee earnings.\
Concentrated ranges tend to earn more — but they require more active management.
