### RPC

<Info>
  When first connecting your MetaMask account to Hedera, you will need to add a JSON-RPC relay to enable communication between MetaMask and Hedera.
</Info>

You have two options for this:

1. Use [ChainList](https://chainlist.org/chain/295) to effortlessly add the Hashio RPC, which is maintained by Swirlds Labs.
2. Manually input the required information for the JSON-RPC relay.
   - **Network Name:** Hedera Mainnet
   - **RPC URL:** https://mainnet.hashio.io/api
   - **Chain ID:** 295
   - **Currency Symbol:** HBAR
   - **Block Explorer URL:** https://hashscan.io/mainnet/dashboard

Either way, this step is crucial for interaction between MetaMask and Hedera.
