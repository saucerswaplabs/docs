## **Senior Frontend Engineer (Design-Oriented)**

**JOB SUMMARY**

SaucerSwap Labs is hiring a Senior Frontend Engineer who can both design and build high-performance DeFi interfaces on Hedera. Remote · Full-time · \$150-190k or ¥ 23.38M – ¥ 29.79M.

**JOB DETAILS**

• Employment type: Full-time 
• Seniority: Senior 
• Job function: Engineering 
• Team: Engineering

**JOB DESCRIPTION**

SaucerSwap Labs builds and maintains the products behind SaucerSwap on Hedera—web and mobile apps, APIs, and analytics—and contributes to the DAO-governed SaucerSwap Protocol. The protocol has processed over \$5 billion in trades across hundreds of tokens, delivering fast, low-fee swaps with open-source transparency. We’re hiring an experienced frontend engineer to design, build, and optimize the next generation of Hedera-native DeFi interfaces.

**Responsibilities:**

- Build and maintain SaucerSwap’s web application in React/TypeScript across trading, pools, portfolio, and analytics views.
- Design and implement end-to-end user flows (e.g., swap, LP, farm, wallet onboarding) from low/medium-fidelity mockups to polished production UI.
- Create and refine components and patterns in Figma and implement them as reusable, well-documented React components.
- Develop clean, responsive, mobile-friendly UIs with strong attention to layout, hierarchy, feedback states, and UX for both power users and newcomers.
- Help evolve and maintain our design system and visual identity in both design and code: tokens, typography, spacing, states, interaction patterns, and component library.
- Implement performant data visualizations (charts, tables, dashboards) to clearly communicate volume, TVL, liquidity, and on-chain activity.
- Integrate UI/frontend components with our APIs and smart contracts: wallet connections, transaction flows, optimistic updates, and status/state handling.
- Maintain high code quality: type safety, modular components, tests (unit/integration), linting, and accessibility best practices.
- Profile and optimize performance (bundle size, load times, layout shifts/render paths) to keep the app fast under heavy load and network spikes.
- Collaborate closely with product, design, backend, protocol engineers, and the community to iterate quickly on UX and ship features end-to-end from spec/idea to production.

**Requirements:**

- 4+ years of professional frontend engineering experience, including 2+ years with React and TypeScript.
- Proven track record/portfolio of complex, user-facing production web apps (SPAs or similar) showing strong implementation quality and UI/UX thinking.
- Demonstrated ability to design and build: you can sketch flows, mock up screens/components in Figma, and then implement them in code.
- Solid grasp of design principles: layout systems (Grid/Flex), spacing, typography, visual hierarchy, and interaction/feedback states.
- Expertise in responsive layout and styling (CSS, Tailwind, or CSS-in-JS) with familiarity in accessibility fundamentals.
- Experience working directly in Figma (or similar): components, variants, auto-layout, and design tokens.
- Strong knowledge of modern frontend tooling: module bundlers, CI pipelines, and testing frameworks (Jest, React Testing Library or similar).
- Experience integrating with REST/GraphQL APIs and handling dynamic or high-frequency data in the UI.
- Familiarity with web3 frontend patterns: wallet connections, signing flows, transaction lifecycle states, and basic EVM concepts.
- Comfortable working in a remote, async team, owning features from idea → design → implementation → iteration/deployment.

**Nice to Haves:**

- Direct experience building DeFi or trading interfaces (DEXs, aggregators, portfolio dashboards)
- Experience with charting/visualization libraries (e.g., Recharts, D3, TradingView or similar)
- Mobile experience (React Native or responsive web optimized for mobile-first DeFi users)
- Performance and security awareness: mitigations for phishing vectors, unsafe signing patterns, and UI/UX-driven user errors
- Experience on Hedera, other EVM chains, or with libraries/wallets in that ecosystem

**Compensation:**

Remote-only, independent contractor; flexible hours with availability for global calls

\$150k-\$190k or ¥ 23.38M – ¥ 29.79M per year, paid bi-weekly on invoice

Payment in USD or Yen

**How to Apply:**

Cover letter summarizing relevant frontend and DeFi/web3 experience

Resume/CV with links to GitHub and shipped products (live URLs or demos)

Brief write-up of a frontend UI/UX or performance issue you diagnosed and solved
