> Hedera's #1 DEX

**SaucerSwap Overview**

The SaucerSwap Protocol is the leading Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and liquidity hub on [Hedera](https://hedera.com/), serving as the ecosystem’s primary gateway for DeFi.

Since its launch in 2022, SaucerSwap has established itself as Hedera’s dominant trading protocol. With over **\$5B in all-time volume** and **15M+ trades**, it provides the essential infrastructure for swapping, liquidity provision, yield farming, and staking.

As the backbone of the Hedera network, SaucerSwap supports deep liquidity for hundreds of HTS tokens. It consistently processes millions of dollars in weekly volume, serving not only as a trading venue but as a critical liquidity layer for native projects. Beyond Hedera, the protocol is actively expanding its reach, leveraging Axelar and LayerZero to bridge users and capital across chains, including SAUCE liquidity integration on Base.

**The Ecosystem** 

SaucerSwap Labs, a Florida-based development firm, builds and maintains the primary access points to the protocol:

- [**SaucerSwap Web App**](https://www.saucerswap.finance/)**:** The premier interface for cross-chain bridging, swapping, and yield generation.
- **SaucerSwap Wallet (**[**iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/saucerswap-hedera-wallet/id6747405489) **& **[**Android**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.saucerswap.mobile)): A self-custody mobile experience optimized for speed, security, and effortless portfolio management.
- [**Developer Infrastructure**](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/v/developer/rest-api/authentication)**:** A suite of robust APIs and smart contracts allowing third-party integrators to seamlessly tap into SaucerSwap’s liquidity.

**Decentralized Governance** 

The protocol is fully community-owned and governed. Through the [**SaucerSwap DAO**](https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance/overview), [SAUCE](https://www.saucerswap.finance/trade/HBAR/0.0.731861) and [xSAUCE](https://www.saucerswap.finance/trade/HBAR/0.0.1460200) holders steer the protocol’s future, voting on reward weights, pool creation, treasury allocation, and tokenomics via on-chain governance.
