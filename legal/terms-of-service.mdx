### 1. Our Services

### 1.1 The Interface and Protocol

The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of access to a decentralized exchange (‚ÄúDEX‚Äù) on one or more public blockchains, including but not limited to Hedera, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets via the SaucerSwap Protocol (the ‚ÄúProtocol‚Äù or ‚ÄúSaucerSwap‚Äù). You understand and acknowledge that the Protocol is not a Service and the protocol is governed in accordance with the documentation located at https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance (‚ÄúGovernance‚Äù).

SaucerSwap Labs does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network and the Protocol is governed in accordance with Governance. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. As a general matter, SaucerSwap Labs is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties. We may curate token lists, routing preferences, and data sources for display purposes; such curation is informational and does not constitute investment advice or best‚Äëexecution.

To access the Protocol, you must use non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service. We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to the Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.

### 1.2 Other Services

We may from time to time in the future offer additional products, and such additional products shall be considered a Service as used herein, regardless of whether such product is specifically defined in this Agreement.

### 1.3 Third Party Services and Content

When you use any of our Services, you may also be using the products, services or content of one or more third parties. Your use of such third-party products, services or content may be subject to separate policies, terms of use and fees of these third parties, and you agree to abide by and be responsible for such policies, terms of use and fees, as applicable.

### 1.4 Mobile Applications

If you download or use any Mobile App, subject to this Agreement we grant you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to install and use the Mobile App on a device you own or control solely to access the Services. Your use of a Mobile App obtained from the Apple App Store or Google Play is also subject to the applicable app-store terms, and you agree to comply with them. We may provide patches, bug fixes, or other updates which may be installed automatically; by using a Mobile App you consent to such updates. Carrier and data charges may apply. You may control push notifications via your device settings.

**App Store Terms.** If you download a Mobile App from the Apple App Store or use it on an iOS device, you acknowledge and agree that: (i) this Agreement is between you and SaucerSwap Labs only, not Apple; (ii) Apple has no obligation to furnish any maintenance or support services with respect to the Mobile App; (iii) in the event of any failure of the Mobile App to conform to any applicable warranty, you may notify Apple and Apple will refund the purchase price (if any) for the Mobile App to you; to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Apple will have no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Mobile App; (iv) Apple is not responsible for addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Mobile App or your possession and/or use of the Mobile App, including product liability claims, any claim that the Mobile App fails to conform to any legal or regulatory requirement, and claims arising under consumer protection, privacy, or similar legislation; and (v) in the event of any third party claim that the Mobile App or your possession and use of the Mobile App infringes that third party‚Äôs intellectual property rights, Apple will not be responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement, and discharge of any such claim. You represent and warrant that you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a ‚Äúterrorist supporting‚Äù country, and that you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties. **Apple and Apple‚Äôs subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement with respect to the Mobile App, and Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary.** Similar terms apply to apps obtained via Google Play with Google and its affiliates as applicable third-party beneficiaries.

**Google Play Terms**. If you obtained a Mobile App via **Google Play** or use it on an Android device: (i) this Agreement is between you and **SaucerSwap Labs** only, not Google; (ii) **we**, not Google, are responsible for the App and its content, maintenance, and legal compliance; (iii) Google has **no obligation** to provide support or warranties, but where applicable may refund the purchase price (if any); (iv) Google is **not responsible** for addressing any claims by you or third parties relating to the App; and (v) **Google and its affiliates are third‚Äëparty beneficiaries** of this Agreement with respect to the App and may enforce it against you as such.

**In-App Browser; External Links.** The Mobile App may display or open third-party websites, dapps, or content in an in-app browser. Such sites and content are not controlled by us and are provided solely for your convenience. Your interactions with them are at your own risk and subject to their terms and privacy policies.

**Side-Loaded Applications.** We distribute the Mobile App only via official app stores. We do not authorize, support, or warrant any version of the Mobile App obtained via side-loading or from any source other than the Apple App Store or Google Play.

**Device Security.** You are responsible for the security of your device, operating system, and any biometric or PIN authentication used to access the Mobile App. Compromised devices may lead to loss of access to your wallet and assets.

### 1.5 APIs and Developer Tools

**Definitions.** ‚ÄúAPI‚Äù means any SaucerSwap Labs endpoint, webhook, SDK, or related documentation we make available. ‚ÄúContent‚Äù means data, analytics, or metadata returned by the API. ‚ÄúApplication‚Äù means any software or service that calls the API. ‚ÄúCompetitive Benchmarking‚Äù means accessing the API principally to benchmark, analyze, or build functionality substantially substitutable for SaucerSwap‚Äôs on-chain liquidity, routing, or settlement services. ‚ÄúRate Limit‚Äù means the maximum units (requests, compute, or bandwidth) permitted per API key in a rolling window, as published in our developer materials.

**Competitive Entity.** ‚ÄúCompetitive Entity‚Äù means any person or entity that builds, markets, or operates products that are substantially substitutable for our on‚Äëchain liquidity, routing, or settlement services.

**Network Health & Differential QoS**. To protect users, the Protocol, and the network, we may prioritize, delay, queue, degrade, or suspend API traffic or features based on security posture, abuse signals, regulatory risk, system load, or Competitive Entity status, and we may require a separate enterprise agreement for access by Competitive Entities.

**Guiding Principles (informational).** We aim to operate the APIs consistent with: (i) _Openness with guardrails_; (ii) _Network health first_; and (iii) _Progressive decentralization_ where appropriate under Governance. These principles are directional and do not create enforceable obligations beyond this Agreement.

**Access & Credentials.** Your use of the APIs is part of the Services and subject to this Agreement and any written or published API rules or developer materials we provide (‚ÄúAPI Rules‚Äù). You must obtain and include a valid API key with each call, keep keys secure, and provide accurate contact and security-response details. Keys are non-transferable without our prior written consent, and you are responsible for all activity under your keys.

**License Grant; Reservation of Rights.** Subject to this Agreement and the API Rules, we grant you a revocable, non-exclusive, worldwide, non-sublicensable, non-transferable license to: (a) invoke documented API methods for your Application; and (b) cache non-public Content for up to twenty-four (24) hours solely to operate your Application (unless the API Rules expressly allow longer retention). We and our licensors retain all right, title, and interest in and to the APIs, the Content, and associated intellectual property.

**Fair-Use Tiers & Rate Limits; Notice of Changes.** Each key is assigned to a published tier (e.g., Community, Pro, Enterprise) with documented ceilings. We may employ automated traffic-shaping and circuit-breakers to throttle, queue, or reject excess traffic that threatens stability. We may adjust quotas or introduce or modify fees or non-security technical requirements. **Where commercially reasonable, we will provide at least thirty (30) days‚Äô advance notice via our developer materials before such non-security, non-compliance changes take effect. For clarity, we have no obligation to grandfather prior pricing, quotas, or terms unless separately agreed in a signed enterprise addendum.**

**Modifications; Suspension; Sunset.** We may add, modify, deprecate, or sunset endpoints, schemas, or features at any time and may suspend or revoke access (including keys) at our discretion. Where practicable, we will provide reasonable notice of non-backwards-compatible changes via our developer materials; **if we discontinue the APIs (in whole or in material part), we will endeavor to provide at least ninety (90) days‚Äô advance notice when commercially reasonable.** Urgent security, abuse, legal, or compliance issues may require immediate changes or suspension.

**Attribution; Usage Transparency.** You must not remove or obscure any attribution or notices we reasonably require and, if requested, must identify your Application by name and provide an operational and security contact.

**Prohibited Conduct (without prior written consent).** You must not: (1) exceed or circumvent Rate Limits or other technical restrictions (including by spreading traffic across multiple keys, rotating IPs, or similar measures); (2) scrape or bulk-extract Content outside the APIs or at scale via spiders, robots, crawlers, or similar tools; (3) use the API, Content, or metadata for Competitive Benchmarking or to build a substantially similar or competing interface or service; (4) resell, broker, or provide the APIs or raw, non-public Content on a standalone, commercial basis; (5) reverse engineer, decompile, reformat, or create derivative works of the APIs or underlying software (except to the extent such restriction is prohibited by applicable law); (6) store raw Content beyond the permitted cache window or otherwise contrary to the API Rules; (7) misrepresent usage, obscure call origin, or falsify metrics reported to SaucerSwap Labs; (8) introduce malicious code or otherwise interfere with the APIs, our network, or other users; (9) violate law or third-party rights, including export controls, sanctions, intellectual-property, privacy, or data-protection obligations; or (10) misrepresent or imply that Content is official, complete, or warranted by SaucerSwap Labs. For purposes of this Agreement, ‚Äúwritten consent‚Äù means a formal, dated instrument executed in writing and bearing the physical or electronic signature of an authorized Managing Member of SaucerSwap Labs, LLC.

**Privacy & Data Handling.** You must comply with all applicable data-protection laws and publish a clear privacy notice if your Application processes personal data. You must not collect, process, or expose personal data from Content except as permitted by the API Rules and applicable law.

**Security Obligations.** You will implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards (including encryption in transit, mitigation of OWASP Top 10 risks, and multi-factor authentication for administrative access). We may request evidence of your security controls or require remedial actions for continued access.

**Fees.** The APIs may be provided without charge, but we may introduce paid tiers or usage-based fees with notice as described above. **We have no obligation to grandfather prior pricing, quotas, or terms unless expressly agreed in a signed enterprise addendum.**

**Export & Sanctions Compliance.** You must not use or export the APIs or Content in violation of applicable export laws or sanctions.

**Termination; Effect of Termination.** We may suspend or terminate your API access for breach of this Agreement, risk to the network or users, or as otherwise permitted herein (email notice when practicable). Upon termination, you must cease all calls and delete all non-public Content in your possession or control, except as required by law.

**Relationship to Other Terms.** This Section is in addition to, and does not limit, the Disclaimers (¬ß5), Indemnification (¬ß6), Limitation of Liability (¬ß7), Governing Law and Dispute Resolution (¬ß8), Modifications (¬ß2), and Intellectual Property (¬ß3) of this Agreement, all of which apply to the APIs and Content.

### 1.6 Beta and Experimental Features

We may label certain features as ‚Äúalpha,‚Äù ‚Äúbeta,‚Äù ‚Äúpreview,‚Äù ‚Äúexperimental,‚Äù or similar. Such features are provided AS IS, may be subject to additional usage limits, may be modified or discontinued at any time, and are excluded from any uptime or support commitments.

You are solely responsible for **setting any slippage tolerance** and reviewing all transaction parameters before submission. Once confirmed on-chain, **transactions are final and irreversible** except to the extent a smart contract reverts by its terms.

### 4.3 Non-Custodial and No Fiduciary Duties

Each of the Services is a purely non-custodial application, meaning we do not ever have custody, possession, or control of your digital assets at any time. It further means you are solely responsible for the custody of the cryptographic private keys to the digital asset wallets you hold and you should never share your wallet credentials or seed phrase with anyone. We accept no responsibility for, or liability to you, in connection with your use of a wallet and make no representations or warranties regarding how any of our Services will operate with any specific wallet. Likewise, you are solely responsible for any associated wallet and we are not liable for any acts or omissions by you in connection with or as a result of your wallet being compromised.

This Agreement is not intended to, and does not, create or impose any fiduciary duties on us. To the fullest extent permitted by law, you acknowledge and agree that we owe no fiduciary duties or liabilities to you or any other party, and that to the extent any such duties or liabilities may exist at law or in equity, those duties and liabilities are hereby irrevocably disclaimed, waived, and eliminated. You further agree that the only duties and obligations that we owe you are those set out expressly in this Agreement.

### 4.4 Compliance and Tax Obligations

One or more of our Services may not be available or appropriate for use in your jurisdiction. By accessing or using any of our Services, you agree that you are solely and entirely responsible for compliance with all laws and regulations that may apply to you.

Specifically, your use of our Services or the Protocol may result in various tax consequences, such as income or capital gains tax, value-added tax, goods and services tax, or sales tax in certain jurisdictions.

It is your responsibility to determine whether taxes apply to any transactions you initiate or receive and, if so, to report and/or remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority.

### 4.7 Interface Fees

SaucerSwap Labs may charge a small percentage fee for the use of the Interface in connection with certain trades on select tokens (‚ÄúInterface Fees‚Äù). Interface Fees **may** be disclosed in the Interface prior to submission of a transaction and **may** vary by asset, route, or other factors; **we are under no obligation to display Interface Fees or fee amounts in the Interface.** We may modify Interface Fees at any time, including for specific assets or routing paths, and we have **no obligation to grandfather** any prior fees or terms. Certain fees may be determined or distributed pursuant to on-chain logic or Governance. We may share Interface Fees with affiliates or ecosystem entities (including a DAO or treasury) as permitted by law and Governance.

### 4.8 Release of Claims

You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of any of our Services or the Protocol. You further expressly waive and release us from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of any of our Services. If you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code ¬ß 1542, which provides: ‚Äú[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.‚Äù

### 4.9 Private Keys, Transactions, and Network Control

- **No custody.** We do not store your private keys, seed phrases, passkeys, recovery methods, or passwords (‚Äú**Private Information**‚Äù).
- **Backups & cloud/passkeys**. You are solely responsible for backing up and securely storing Private Information, including any **cloud backups or device keychain/passkey storage** and any **biometric or PIN** unlock you enable. **We cannot recover** lost credentials.
- **No access to funds**. We do not have access to or control over your wallet or funds and cannot retrieve, freeze, or reverse transactions.
- **Transactions & finality.** The **Hedera** network processes transactions; consensus timestamps and fair ordering are determined by the network‚Äînot by us. Mirror nodes provide historical data but do not participate in consensus. Delivery, inclusion, or finality are not guaranteed.
- **Fees**. Network fees (e.g., HBAR fees) are set by the Hedera network. We are not responsible for losses due to network fees or incorrectly set fees.
- **No control over blockchains**. We do not create or control the blockchains you interact with; balances and history are recorded on the network (including via mirror nodes), not by us.
- **Token & metadata risk**. Anyone can create tokens or NFTs, including **spoofs, dust/airdrop tokens**, or tokens with **deceptive metadata or icons.** Displayed names, logos, prices, or attributes may be wrong, stale, or incomplete.
- **Device security**. You are responsible for the security of your device and OS. Compromise may lead to loss of access to your wallet and assets.
- If you do not understand the foregoing, learn more about cryptographic wallets and digital assets before proceeding.

### 4.10 No Money Transmission; No Brokerage; No Custody

SaucerSwap Labs does not provide money transmission, custodial, escrow, clearing, or settlement services and does not accept, hold, or transfer fiat currency or digital assets on your behalf. We do not broker orders, route or match orders, or otherwise act as an agent for order execution. You are solely responsible for initiating transactions via your non-custodial wallet. Nothing in the Services constitutes activity requiring registration or licensing as a money services business, money transmitter, broker-dealer, commodity trading advisor, futures commission merchant, or similar under applicable law.

### 4.11 Chain Events; Forks; Reorganizations; Upgrades

Public blockchain networks may experience chain reorganizations (‚Äúreorgs‚Äù), hard or soft forks, protocol upgrades, parameter changes, validator/node outages, or other material events. Such events can affect transaction ordering, finality, token metadata, balances as displayed by indexers or mirror nodes, routing paths, and the availability or behavior of the Protocol. We do not control these events and have no obligation to support, resolve, or remediate any impact they may have on the Services or your transactions or assets.

### 8. Governing Law, Dispute Resolution and Class Action Waivers

### 8.1 Governing Law

You agree that the laws of the State of Florida, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, govern this Agreement and any Dispute between you and us. You further agree that each of our Services shall be deemed to be based solely in the State of Florida, and that although a Service may be available in other jurisdictions, its availability does not give rise to general or specific personal jurisdiction in any forum outside the State of Florida. The parties acknowledge that this Agreement evidences interstate commerce. Any arbitration conducted pursuant to this Agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. You agree that the federal courts of the Middle District of Florida and the state courts of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida are the exclusive forums for any appeals of an arbitration award or for court proceedings in the event that this Agreement‚Äôs binding arbitration clause is found to be unenforceable.

### 8.2 Dispute Resolution

We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to [legal@saucerswap.finance](mailto:legal@saucerswap.finance) so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren‚Äôt able to reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.

At our sole discretion, we may elect to submit any Dispute to non-binding mediation. If an election to mediate is made, then such mediation shall be held in Duval or Nassau County, Florida, unless the parties agree otherwise, and it shall be conducted by a mediator selected by us. We reserve the right to appear by video conference to the fullest extent permitted by law.

Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to any of our Services, this Agreement, or any other acts or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable, including, but not limited to, any claim or controversy as to arbitrability (‚ÄúDispute‚Äù), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration conducted by the American Arbitration Association (the ‚ÄúAAA‚Äù) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (the ‚ÄúAAA Rules‚Äù) then in effect, except as modified by this Agreement. A party who wishes to start arbitration must submit a written demand for arbitration to the AAA and give notice to the other party as specified in the AAA Rules and per Section 9.5 of this Agreement. The arbitration shall be selected pursuant to the AAA Rules. The arbitration will be held in Duval or Nassau County, Florida, unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If for any reason a claim by law or equity must proceed in court rather than in arbitration you agree to waive any right to a jury trial and any claim may be brought only in the federal courts of the Middle District of Florida or the state courts of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Florida.

The parties will each pay their own attorney‚Äôs fees and arbitration costs, unless the arbitrator makes an affirmative finding that a party‚Äôs claim is frivolous, in which case the party asserting the frivolous claim will be required to pay the other party‚Äôs attorney‚Äôs fees and arbitration costs.

### 8.3 Class Action and Jury Trial Waiver

You must bring any and all Disputes against us in your individual capacity and not as a plaintiff in or member of any purported class action, collective action, private attorney general action, or other representative proceeding. This provision applies to class arbitration. You and we both agree to waive the right to demand a trial by jury.
