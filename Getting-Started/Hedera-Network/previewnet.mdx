Hedera Previewnet is an early-access version of the network where developers can test new features that haven’t been released to the Mainnet or Testnet yet. It’s like a sneak peek environment for upcoming updates. Since Previewnet is for early testing, it might be less stable, but it helps developers prepare for changes before they go live on the main network.
