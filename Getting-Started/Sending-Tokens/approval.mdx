An approval transaction gives a smart contract permission to move your tokens.

Before you swap certain tokens (like USDC, SAUCE, etc.), you must approve the swap contract to spend that token on your behalf.

Approval is a **separate** transaction from the actual swap and usually costs a small network fee.
