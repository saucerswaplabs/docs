title: "Why do HBAR swaps involve converting to WHBAR?"

HBAR (the native token) isn’t an HTS token by default — it’s built differently at the network level.

To make it compatible with decentralized apps (like SaucerSwap), it’s automatically **wrapped** into **Wrapped HBAR (WHBAR)**.

WHBAR is an HTS token that behaves like HBAR but can interact with smart contracts and liquidity pools.

When you swap HBAR on SaucerSwap, it’s automatically wrapped into WHBAR behind the scenes to complete the swap.
