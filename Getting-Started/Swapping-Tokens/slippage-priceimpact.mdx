**Price Impact** is the natural shift in price caused by the size of your trade.\
**Price Slippage** is the acceptable difference between the expected price and the final price youâ€™re willing to tolerate.\
\
**In short:**

- Price impact = actual effect _your_ trade has on the market.
- Slippage = the "wiggle room" you're allowing for unexpected price changes.

If your price impact exceeds your slippage tolerance, the swap will fail.
