A crypto wallet securely stores your cryptocurrency and allows you to send, receive, and manage tokens on blockchains or cryptocurrency networks. It doesn’t actually hold the coins themselves — they remain on the blockchain/network — but the wallet allows you to securely manage your assets. 

Crypto wallets can be software-based (like mobile apps or browser extensions) or hardware devices (physical wallets that store keys offline for extra security). 

Whether you’re trading, buying, or simply holding crypto, a wallet is essential for safely managing your digital funds.
