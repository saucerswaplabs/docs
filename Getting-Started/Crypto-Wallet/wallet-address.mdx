A crypto wallet address is a unique public identifier used to receive cryptocurrencies, similar to an email address for digital assets. Each wallet address is tied to your wallet’s private key, allowing you to access and manage the funds sent to that address. 

Wallet addresses are specific to each blockchain — for example, a Bitcoin address is different from an Ethereum or Hedera address.
