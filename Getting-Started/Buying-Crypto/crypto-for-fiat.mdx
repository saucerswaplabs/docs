To sell crypto for fiat (like USD, EUR, or other government-issued money), you usually need to:

1. **Transfer your crypto** to an exchange that supports fiat withdrawals (like Coinbase, Binance, or [Crypto.com](http://Crypto.com)).
2. **Sell** your crypto for fiat currency inside the exchange.
3. **Withdraw** the fiat money to your linked bank account.

**Note:** SaucerSwap doesn’t directly convert crypto to fiat — it focuses on crypto-to-crypto swaps.
