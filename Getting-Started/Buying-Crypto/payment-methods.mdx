When buying crypto (especially via Coinbase Onramp or major exchanges), common payment methods include:

- Debit cards
- Bank transfers (ACH in the U.S.)
- Wire transfers
- Sometimes Apple Pay or Google Pay (depending on your country)

Credit cards are usually **not** accepted anymore for crypto purchases.
